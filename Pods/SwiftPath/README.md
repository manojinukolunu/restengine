# SwiftPath
JSONPath for Swift

### Problem
Somtimes, you don't want to hard-code the mapping from JSON to your model. You may want a generic way to model data from different sources. You may want to be able to update your remote data structure without having to update your app binary.


### Solution
SwiftPath allows you to keep your data source **and** your data mapping dynamic.


## Installation

Analytics is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) and [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).
